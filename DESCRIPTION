Description: 
	This package is designed to analyse tree stem phyto-demographic data from
	plots measured at discrete time points (censuses).
	1. Calculate individual stem growth rates.
	2. Identify survivors, new recruits and deaths.
	3. Estimate rates of productivity using equations from Kohyama et al. (2019) and Talbot et al. (2014).
	4. Estimate vital rates using equations from Kohyama et al. (2018).
